<div id="story">
<p>Across the globe, humble legumes of every color and size: from black turtle beans to white cannellinis, from tiny red lentils to giant cranberry beans, form the basis of classic, nourishing food enjoyed by rich and poor alike.
</p>
<p>The bean truck is based on a simple philosophy: that healthy, tasty food can be affordable and fun! We draw on cuisines from around the world to make protein-rich, hearty soups, stews, sandwiches and more.
</p>
<p>So, if you need a real meal, and you don't want to spend a lot of money, look for the Bean Truck on a street near you!
